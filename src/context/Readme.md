# **ThemeSwitcherContext.jsx**

1. **Import Statements:**

    - `createContext` and `useState` are imported from React. `createContext` is used to create a new context, and `useState` is a hook that lets you add React state to function components.
    - `PropTypes` is imported from the 'prop-types' package, which is used for typechecking the props passed to a component.

2. **Creating a Context:**

    - `export const ThemeSwitcherContext = createContext();`
    - This line creates a new context object. Contexts in React are used to share data (in this case, theme-related data) that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components.

3. **Creating a Provider Component:**

    - `export const ThemeSwitcherProvider = ({ children }) => { ... };`
    - This is a functional component called `ThemeSwitcherProvider`. It's designed to wrap other components and provide them access to the context.
    - `children` is a prop that represents the child components of `ThemeSwitcherProvider`. This is a common pattern in React for components that are meant to wrap other components.

4. **Using useState Hook:**

    - `const [theme, setTheme] = useState("light");`
    - This line initializes a new state variable `theme` with the default value `"light"`. The `setTheme` function is used to update this value. This state will hold the current theme and will be accessible to all child components of `ThemeSwitcherProvider`.

5. **Providing Context Value:**

    - `<ThemeSwitcherContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>`
    - This line uses the `Provider` component of `ThemeSwitcherContext` to pass the `theme` and `setTheme` to its child components. Any component that needs access to the theme or needs to update it can now tap into this context.

6. **Rendering Children:**

    - `{children}`
    - This renders the child components of `ThemeSwitcherProvider`. These children will have access to the context.

7. **PropTypes for Validation:**

    - `ThemeSwitcherProvider.propTypes = { children: PropTypes.node.isRequired, };`
    - This line sets the prop types for `ThemeSwitcherProvider`. It ensures that `children` is passed to the component and that it is of the type `node` (which is a generic type for any React component).
