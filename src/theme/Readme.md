# **ThemeSwitcherComponent.jsx**

1. **Import Statements:**

    - `useEffect` and `useRef` are imported from React. `useEffect` is a hook that runs side effects in function components, and `useRef` is used to persistently store a mutable value across renders.
    - `RiSunLine` and `RiMoonFill` are imported from `react-icons/ri`, which is a library of React icon components.
    - `PropTypes` is imported from 'prop-types' for validating the types of properties passed to the component.

2. **ThemeSwitcherComponent Function:**

    - The `ThemeSwitcherComponent` is a functional component that takes `theme` and `setTheme` as props.
    - `theme` is a string that represents the current theme (e.g., 'light' or 'dark').
    - `setTheme` is a function that is used to update the theme.

3. **Using useRef Hook:**

    - `const bodyRef = useRef(document.body);`
    - This line creates a ref object that points to the `document.body`. This ref is used to directly manipulate the DOM, which is generally not recommended in React, but can be necessary for certain operations like manipulating global styles.

4. **Using useEffect Hook:**

    - The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects. In this case, it's used to update the class of the `body` element whenever the `theme` changes.
    - The effect removes the 'light' and 'dark' classes from `document.body` and then adds the current `theme` as a class. This is a way to apply global theme styles.

5. **toggleTheme Function:**

    - `const toggleTheme = () => { ... };`
    - This function toggles the theme between 'light' and 'dark'. It checks the current `theme` and sets it to the opposite value using the `setTheme` function.

6. **Rendering:**

    - The component returns a button element. When clicked, it calls the `toggleTheme` function.
    - The button's content changes based on the current theme: it shows `RiSunLine` for the light theme and `RiMoonFill` for the dark theme.

7. **PropTypes:**

    - `ThemeSwitcherComponent.propTypes = { ... };`
    - This part of the code is used for type checking the props passed to `ThemeSwitcherComponent`. It ensures that `theme` is a string and `setTheme` is a function, and both are required for the component to function properly.
